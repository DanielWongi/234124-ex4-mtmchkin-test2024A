1. **First**, create a `test` folder in the root directory of the project. 

    Note: The project files should **not** be inside the `test` folder. They should be located in the root of the `project` directory, as shown below:

    ```
    project/
    ├── project files here
    └── test/
    ```

    This structure ensures that your project files and test directory are organized correctly within your project's root directory.

2. Extract the zip file inside the `test` folder.
3. Navigate to the `test` directory and execute the 3 commands (**second command if needed**):
```bash
make -f makefileMtmchkinTests
```
```bash
chmod +x tester.sh
```
```bash
./tester.sh
```
